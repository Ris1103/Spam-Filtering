# Spam-Filtering

This project is a simple email spam classifier. It uses machine learning to classify whether a provided email is spam or not.

## Web Application

The classifier is wrapped in a web application built with Flask. Users can paste an email into a form on the web page, and the application will classify the email as spam or not.

## Deployment

The web application is deployed on Render. You can access it at the following URL:

## Usage

To use the application, simply paste your email into the text area and click the "Check Spam" button. The application will then tell you whether the email is likely to be spam or not.
